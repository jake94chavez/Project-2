# Project-2 Express App
***
## Proposal

### The App
My objective with this app is to create a personal directory of books that the user has read and intends to read. It should function as a goal list. I recently made the decision to try and read more books so now I want to build a tool that would allow myself and others to keep better track of what they have been reading and what they want or intend to read. The books will contain information about the book such as the author and the original release date. I would also like to add a feature that allows a user to make comments of their thoughts on the book.


### User Personas
+ Samuel Clemens
	+ Sam is a casual reader that wants to keep track of everything he has read and jot down his personal thoughts on each book. He believes that good friends, good books, and sleepy conscience is the ideal life.
+ Andy Reid
	+ Andy is a very organized person and likes to lay out his goals in an orderly fashion. He takes his time preparing for his goals and properly organizing so that he doesn't forget anything. He has set a goal to read more books this year and wants to keep an organized list of all of the books he sees or hears about and plans to read.
